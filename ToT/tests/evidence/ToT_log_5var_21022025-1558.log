Task Description: Given the provided premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm only by following instructions given below. Do not provide any additional information or assumptions.
Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 5 variables, A, B, C, D and E. All the statistical relations among these 5 variables are as follows: A correlates with B. A correlates with C. A correlates with D. A correlates with E. B correlates with C. B correlates with D. B correlates with E. C correlates with D. C correlates with E. D correlates with E. However, A and C are independent given B. A and C are independent given B and E. B and E are independent given A. B and E are independent given A and C. B and E are independent given A, C and D.

Task Description: Given the provided premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm only by following instructions given below. Do not provide any additional information or assumptions.
Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 5 variables, A, B, C, D and E. All the statistical relations among these 5 variables are as follows: A correlates with B. A correlates with C. A correlates with D. A correlates with E. B correlates with C. B correlates with D. B correlates with E. C correlates with D. C correlates with E. D correlates with E. However, A and C are independent given B. A and C are independent given B and E. B and E are independent given A. B and E are independent given A and C. B and E are independent given A, C and D. B and E are independent given A and D. C and E are independent given A. C and E are independent given A and B. C and E are independent given A, B and D. C and E are independent given A and D. C and E are independent given B. D and E are independent given A. D and E are independent given A and B. D and E are independent given A, B and C. D and E are independent given A and C.


Step 1 - Read the Data:
- Extracted variables: A, B, C, D, E
- Correlations: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, D), (C, E), (D, E)
- Independencies:
  - A and C are independent given B
  - A and C are independent given B and E
  - B and E are independent given A
  - B and E are independent given A and C
  - B and E are independent given A, C and D
  - B and E are independent given A and D
  - C and E are independent given A
  - C and E are independent given A and B

  - C and E are independent given B
  - D and E are independent given A
  - D and E are independent given A and B
  - D and E are independent given A, B and C
  - D and E are independent given A and C


Step 2 - Initialize the Graph:
- Created edges between all correlated variable pairs.
- Initial edges: {(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, D), (C, E), (D, E)}
- Connections for each node:
  - A: {B, C, D, E}
  - B: {A, C, D, E}
  - C: {A, B, D, E}
  - D: {A, B, C, E}
  - E: {A, B, C, D}


Next step instruction (focus exclusively on this step):
Apply Independencies
- Remove edges based on independencies.
- Specify which independencies led to each removal.


Step example (for guidance, only for this step):
Example for Step 3 – Apply Independencies:
- Because B and D are independent given A, there is no edge between B and D.
- Because C and D are independent given A, there is no edge between C and D.


IMPORTANT:
- Your response MUST ONLY address the above step.

Task Description: Given the provided premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm only by following instructions given below. Do not provide any additional information or assumptions.
Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 5 variables, A, B, C, D and E. All the statistical relations among these 5 variables are as follows: A correlates with B. A correlates with C.

Next step instruction (focus exclusively on this step):
Compile the Causal Undirected Skeleton
- List every variable (node) identified in the premise.
- For each node, list all other nodes it is connected to based on the correlations.
- Exclude any edge that should be removed due to a declared independency.
- Ensure the final graph reflects both:
    - All existing correlations as edges, and
    - The absence of edges where independencies apply.
- Format the output in a clear, consistent manner, for example:
    In this graph:
    - Node A is connected to nodes B, C.
    - Node B is connected to node A.
    - Node C is connected to node A.
    - Node D has no connections.
Compile the Causal Undirected Skeleton
- List each node with its connected nodes.
- Ensure all applied independencies are reflected accurately.


Step example (for guidance, only for this step):
Example for Step 4 – Compile the Causal Undirected Skeleton:
In this graph:
  - Node A is connected to nodes B, D, C.
  - Node B is connected to nodes C.
  - Node C has no connections.
  - Node D has no connections.

And the following candidate step:
In this graph:
- Node A is connected to nodes B, C, D.
- Node B is connected to nodes A, C.
- Node C is connected to nodes A, B.
- Node D is connected to nodes A, B, C.
- Node E has no connections.

Please evaluate the candidate step with respect to these constraints:
Compile the Causal Undirected Skeleton
- List every variable (node) identified in the premise.
- For each node, list all other nodes it is connected to based on the correlations.
- Exclude any edge that should be removed due to a declared independency.
- Ensure the final graph reflects both:
    - All existing correlations as edges, and
    - The absence of edges where independencies apply.
- Format the output in a clear, consistent manner, for example:
    In this graph:
    - Node A is connected to nodes B, C.
    - Node B is connected to node A.
    - Node C is connected to node A.
    - Node D has no connections.
Compile the Causal Undirected Skeleton
- List each node with its connected nodes.
- Ensure all applied independencies are reflected accurately.


Consider the following criteria:
- Does the candidate step correctly implement the change(s) specified?
- Are all nodes and edges (or removals) consistent with the overall constraints?
- Is the candidate step detailed enough to reflect the intended modifications?

Rate on a scale from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent) how well the candidate step satisfies the constraints.

IMPORTANT:
- Your response MUST be exactly one integer number between 0 and 10.
- Do NOT include any extra text, explanation, or additional characters.

For example, if you believe the state is excellent, simply respond with:
