    As the causal graph problem, given the provided premise and by using the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm your task is to verify relationship between two nodes.
    Premise: {premise}

    Specifically focus on the relationship between nodes {edge_from} and {edge_to}.
    Should there be a direct edge between these nodes in the undirected causal skeleton?

    Consider all provided independencies statements from the given premise carefully.
    Answer with only YES or NO.

    For the causal graph problem: {problem_statement}

    I've determined the following edges in the causal undirected skeleton:
    {formatted_edges}

    Please verify if this set of edges satisfies all the given independencies and correlations.
    If not, what specific changes are needed?

    Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
    {{
        "is_consistent": true/false,
        "edges_to_add": [["A", "B"], ["C", "D"], ...],
        "edges_to_remove": [["E", "F"], ["G", "H"], ...]
    }}
