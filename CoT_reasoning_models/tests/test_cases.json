    "answer": "Based on the PC algorithm, we start with a fully connected graph among the 6 variables {A, B, C, D, E, F} since all pairs are correlated. Then we review every pair and remove an edge if we find any independence statement (whether marginal or conditional) for that pair.\n\nBelow is our step‐by-step elimination process:\n\n1. A–B: There is no independence statement indicating that A and B are independent. (Keep edge A–B.)\n\n2. A–C: Multiple statements indicate that A and C are independent conditioned on various subsets (e.g. “A and C are independent given B”). This is enough to remove the edge A–C.\n\n3. A–D: There is no statement indicating A and D are independent in any condition. (Keep edge A–D.)\n\n4. A–E: Likewise, no independence statement was provided for A–E. (Keep edge A–E.)\n\n5. A–F: No independence statement regarding A and F was provided. (Keep edge A–F.)\n\n6. B–C: There is no statement showing that B and C become independent given any set. (Keep edge B–C.)\n\n7. B–D: There is no independence statement for B and D. (Keep edge B–D.)\n\n8. B–E: There is no independence statement for B and E. (Keep edge B–E.)\n\n9. B–F: Several conditional independence statements show B and F to be independent (e.g. “B and F are independent given A and C”). Therefore, the edge between B and F is removed.\n\n10. C–D: Several conditional independence statements show C and D to be independent (e.g. “C and D are independent given A and B”). Hence, remove the edge C–D.\n\n11. C–E: Multiple statements indicate that C and E are independent (e.g. “C and E are independent given A and B”). Remove the edge C–E.\n\n12. C–F: There is no independence statement involving C and F. (Keep edge C–F.)\n\n13. D–E: No independence statement leads to this pair becoming independent. (Keep edge D–E.)\n\n14. D–F: Multiple conditional independence statements show that D and F are independent (e.g. “D and F are independent given A and B”). Thus, remove the edge D–F.\n\n15. E–F: Several statements show that E and F are independent conditioned on various subsets (e.g. “E and F are independent given A and B”). Remove the edge E–F.\n\nAfter applying these removals, the remaining edges in our undirected skeleton are:\n• A–B\n• A–D\n• A–E\n• A–F\n• B–C\n• B–D\n• B–E\n• C–F\n• D–E\n\nWe now provide the final answer in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal Answer:\n------------------------------------------------\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"],\n  \"edges\": [\n    [\"A\", \"B\"],\n    [\"A\", \"D\"],\n    [\"A\", \"E\"],\n    [\"A\", \"F\"],\n    [\"B\", \"C\"],\n    [\"B\", \"D\"],\n    [\"B\", \"E\"],\n    [\"C\", \"F\"],\n    [\"D\", \"E\"]\n  ]\n}",

    "answer": "Based on the premise, we start with a fully connected undirected graph among the six variables {A, B, C, D, E, F} (i.e. every pair of variables has an edge because they are correlated). Then we remove an edge if any of the provided independence (conditional or marginal) statements indicate that the two nodes are independent.\n\nStep 1. List of initially present edges (15 total):\n\n• A -- B  \n• A -- C  \n• A -- D  \n• A -- E  \n• A -- F  \n• B -- C  \n• B -- D  \n• B -- E  \n• B -- F  \n• C -- D  \n• C -- E  \n• C -- F  \n• D -- E  \n• D -- F  \n• E -- F  \n\nStep 2. Remove edges based on independence statements:\n\n1. “A and C are independent given B”  \n  → Remove edge A -- C.\n\n2. “A and F are independent given B, C, D and E” (and additional statements all involving various sets among B, C, D, and E)  \n  → Remove edge A -- F.\n\n3. “B and D are independent given A and C” (as well as additional statements involving A, C plus E or F)  \n  → Remove edge B -- D.\n\n4. “B and E are independent given A and C” (as well as additional statements involving A, C plus D or F)  \n  → Remove edge B -- E.\n\n5. “B and F are independent given A and C” (with further statements including A, C plus D, E as well as other combinations)  \n  → Remove edge B -- F.\n\n6. “C and F are independent given A, B, D and E” (plus other combinations)  \n  → Remove edge C -- F.\n\nStep 3. Identify remaining edges:\n\n- A still is connected to B, D, and E.\n- B is connected to A and C (after removal of B--D, B--E, B--F).\n- C is connected to B, D, and E (after removal of A--C, C--F).\n- D is connected to A, C, E, and F.\n- E is connected to A, C, D, and F.\n- F is connected to D and E (after removal of A--F, B--F, C--F).\n\nThus, the remaining edges are:\n\n• A -- B  \n• A -- D  \n• A -- E  \n• B -- C  \n• C -- D  \n• C -- E  \n• D -- E  \n• D -- F  \n• E -- F  \n\nThe final undirected skeleton (graph) is expressed in the JSON format below:\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n{\n  \"nodes\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"],\n  \"edges\": [\n    [\"A\", \"B\"],\n    [\"A\", \"D\"],\n    [\"A\", \"E\"],\n    [\"B\", \"C\"],\n    [\"C\", \"D\"],\n    [\"C\", \"E\"],\n    [\"D\", \"E\"],\n    [\"D\", \"F\"],\n    [\"E\", \"F\"]\n  ]\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------",
