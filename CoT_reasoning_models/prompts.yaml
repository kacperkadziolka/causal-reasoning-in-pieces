  Task: Based on the given Premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm to identify a causal undirected skeleton from the correlations and independence statements.

  Key Principles:
  - Initially, assume all correlated variables are connected
  - An edge X--Y should be removed if ANY independence statement shows X and Y are independent (marginally or conditionally)
  - Keep all edges unless contradicted by an explicit independence statement
  - The final skeleton should reflect all independence relationships in the data

  Your analysis should be thorough but focused on removing edges based on independence statements.

  Required Output Format:
  After completing your analysis, provide your final answer in this exact JSON format:

  ```json
  {{
    "nodes": ["list", "of", "nodes"],
    "edges": [
      ["Node1", "Node2"],
      ["Node2", "Node3"]
    ]
  }}
  ```
