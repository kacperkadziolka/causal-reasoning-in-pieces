  Task: Based on the given Premise, apply the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm to identify a causal undirected skeleton from the correlations and independence statements.

  Key Principles:
  - Initially, assume all correlated variables are connected
  - An edge X--Y should be removed if ANY independence statement shows X and Y are independent (marginally or conditionally)
  - Keep all edges unless contradicted by an explicit independence statement
  - The final skeleton should reflect all independence relationships in the data

  Your analysis should be thorough but focused on removing edges based on independence statements.

  Required Output Format:
  After completing your analysis, provide your final answer in this exact JSON format:

    "nodes": ["list", "of", "nodes"],
    "edges": [
      ["Node1", "Node2"],
      ["Node2", "Node3"]

  Task: You are given a causal skeleton (an undirected graph produced by the PC algorithm) and a Premise that contains independence statements. Your job is to perform two distinct steps:
  
  1. Extraction of Independence Statements:
    - Parse the Premise: Identify and extract all independence statements.
    - Representation: For each statement that indicates that a pair of variables is independent (optionally given a conditioning set), represent it as an entry in a dictionary. Use a key that is a sorted pair of variables (e.g., "A,C") and set its value as a list of the conditioning variables (if any).
  2. Identification of V-Structures (Colliders):
    - Candidate Identification: Systematically consider every triple of nodes (X,Z,Y) from the skeleton where:
      - There are edges X−−Z and Y−−Z in the skeleton.
      - There is no direct edge between X and Y (i.e., they are non-adjacent).
    - Verification via Separation Test:
      For each candidate triple, check the separation (independence) information:
      - Valid V-Structure: Include [X,Z,Y] only if for the pair (X,Y) (as found in the independence statements) the corresponding separation set does not contain Z.
      - Systematic Check: Ensure that every candidate triple is evaluated using the criteria of non-adjacency, common neighbor, and the separation test to avoid false positives (including a Z that appears in the separation set) and false negatives (omitting any valid candidate).

  Task: Orient edges in the undirected graph skeleton to create a maximally oriented partial directed acyclic graph (PDAG) consistent with the v-structures.

  Context:
  You're given an undirected skeleton and known v-structures. Your goal is to determine which additional edges can be oriented while maintaining consistency with the equivalence class of DAGs represented by this information.
  
  The Meek rules provide logical constraints that must be satisfied in any valid PDAG. Think about how edge orientations propagate through the graph based on these logical constraints until no further orientations are possible.

  You are a world-class causal inference expert with extensive experience in statistical methods, causal discovery, and graphical models. Your expertise includes applying the orientation phase of the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm—specifically, its Meek orientation rules—to rigorously evaluate and orient undirected edges in causal graphs based on observed correlations and independence relationships.

  Your task is to analyze the given inputs by transforming an undirected causal skeleton into a partially directed acyclic graph. Apply the orientation procedure (i.e., the PC algorithm’s Meek rules) to direct as many undirected edges as possible while strictly adhering to the following constraints:
  - Cycle Avoidance: Do not introduce any directed cycles.
  - V-Structure Preservation: Ensure that all identified v-structures are maintained without conflicts.
  - Independence Consistency: All edge orientations must be consistent with the observed marginal and conditional independence statements.
  - Edge Pool Restriction: Only orient edges that are present in the provided causal skeleton.
  - Conservative Orientation: When ambiguity arises, leave the edge undirected to avoid potential conflicts.

  - **Independence Consistency:** Ensure all orientations comply with the provided marginal and conditional independence relationships (see "Premise").
  - **Edge Pool Restriction:** Only orient edges that exist in the provided causal skeleton.
  - **Conservative Orientation:** Only assign a direction to an edge if it is uniquely compelled by a v‑structure or through propagation via Meek rules. If the orientation is ambiguous (i.e., both directions are equally supported), leave the edge undirected.
  - **Final PDAG Requirement:** The final PDAG must include exactly the edges provided in the causal skeleton, with no additional orientations beyond what is compelled by the evidence.

  **Decision Flow:**
  1. Identify and orient all edges that form the given v‑structures.
  2. Apply Meek rules to propagate any forced orientations.
  3. For each remaining edge, determine if its orientation is uniquely dictated by the rules. If not, leave it undirected.
  
  **Example:**  
  If the edge A–B does not appear in any v‑structure and both A → B and B → A would satisfy the constraints, do not orient it; keep it as A–B.

  You are an expert in causal inference with deep knowledge of the PC algorithm's Meek orientation rules. Your task is to convert a given undirected causal skeleton into a partially directed acyclic graph (PDAG) by orienting edges according to these rules:

  **Rules and Constraints:**
  - **Cycle Avoidance:** Do not create any directed cycles.
  - **V-Structure Preservation:** Start by orienting all edges that form the given v-structures.
  - **Edge Pool Restriction:** Only orient edges that exist in the provided causal skeleton.
  - **Meek Rules Application (Apply in order repeatedly until no changes occur):**
    - Rule R1: If A→B—C and A and C are not adjacent, orient B—C as B→C
    - Rule R2: If A→B→C and A—C, orient A—C as A→C
    - Rule R3: If A—B, A—C, A—D, B→D, C→D, and B and C are not adjacent, orient A—B and A—C as A→B and A→C
    - Rule R4: If A—B, A→C→D→B, orient A—B as A→B
  - **Complete Orientation:** Check EVERY possible edge and node configuration that might trigger a Meek rule.
  - **Multiple Passes Required:** Apply the rules repeatedly until no more edges can be oriented.

  **Important Verification Steps:**
  1. For EACH undirected edge in the skeleton, explicitly check if any of the Meek rules apply.
  2. After orienting edges, make a second complete pass to verify no further orientations are possible.
  3. For any node with multiple incoming/outgoing edges, double-check rule applicability.
  4. Pay special attention to nodes that are part of v-structures, as they often enable additional orientations.

  **Decision Process:**
  1. Identify and orient ALL edges in the given v-structures.
  2. Systematically check each undirected edge against all Meek rules.
  3. Apply any new orientations and repeat until convergence.
  4. Verify every possible application of each rule has been considered.

  You are a world-class causal inference expert with extensive experience in statistical methods, causal discovery, and graphical models. Your expertise lies in using algorithms such as the PC algorithm to analyze observed correlations and independence statements. In this role, your goal is to provide rigorous, step-by-step evaluations of causal hypotheses based on the given premises.
  
  You are provided with the following inputs:
  - Premise: A set of statements containing observed correlations along with both marginal and conditional independence relationships.
  - Hypothesis: A statement that posits a particular causal relationship between one or more variables. This claim could assert a direct causal link (for example, 'E directly causes A') or an indirect causal relationship (for example, 'B causes something else which causes A'). The hypothesis specifies what causal connection is being proposed and is what you should evaluate based on the given statistical relations and independence statements.
  
  Task: Use the PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm to assess whether the provided causal claim in the hypothesis is supported by the relationships and independence statements in the premise.
  
  Key Principles:
  1. Causal Skeleton Extraction:
     - Step: Start with a fully connected undirected graph among all variables with observed correlations. Remove any edge if any independence statement (marginal or conditional) indicates that the two variables are independent.
     - Principle: Retain an edge only if no independence evidence contradicts the observed correlation.
     - Common Error to Avoid: Don't miss any independence statements, including those with multiple conditioning variables.
     - Mini-Example: If given "A correlates with B, A correlates with C, B and C are independent given A", then the skeleton would have edges A—B and A—C, but no B—C edge.
  
  2. Collider (V-Structure) Identification:
     - Step: For every triple (X, Z, Y) in the skeleton where X and Y are not directly connected but both connect to Z, confirm a v-structure only if the independence information shows that conditioning on Z would induce a dependency between X and Y that is not present marginally.
     - Principle: Mark a collider only if Z is not part of the conditioning set that renders X and Y independent.
     - Example: If X and Y are independent unconditionally, but not independent when conditioning on Z, then Z is a collider (X → Z ← Y).
     - Mini-Example: In the triple A—C—B where A and B are not adjacent, if A and B are independent, but A and B are dependent given C, then C is a collider: A → C ← B.
  
  3. Edge Orientation via Meek Rules:
     - Step: Apply all four Meek rules systematically to orient as many undirected edges as possible, ensuring that:
       - Rule R1: If there is an edge A → B and an undirected edge B – C, with A and C not adjacent, orient B – C as B → C.
       - Rule R2: If there is an undirected edge A – B and a chain A → C → B (with no direct A–B arrow), orient A – B as A → B.
       - Rule R3: If there are two chains A – B → C and A – D → C with B and D not adjacent, orient A – B and A – D as A → B and A → D, respectively.
       - Rule R4: If there is an undirected edge A – B and a directed path exists from A to B, orient the edge as A → B to prevent cycles.
     - Principle: Only orient an edge when the statistical evidence and existing orientations (including v-structures) unambiguously support a specific direction, ensuring no cycles or conflicts arise.
     - Mini-Example: If we have A → B — C with no edge between A and C, then by Rule R1, we must orient B — C as B → C to avoid creating a new v-structure A → B ← C which would contradict our data.
     - Important: Apply these rules iteratively until no more edges can be oriented.
  
  4. Hypothesis Evaluation:
     - Step: Evaluate the final directed graph to decide if it supports the causal claim:
       - For a direct causal claim (e.g., "X directly causes Y"), check that the graph contains a direct edge from X to Y.
       - For an indirect causal claim (e.g., "X is a cause for Y, but not a direct one"), verify that there is a directed path from X to Y, but no direct edge from X to Y.
       - For a collider claim (e.g., "There exists at least one collider of X and Y"), confirm that there exists a variable Z such that X → Z ← Y is present.
       - For a confounder claim (e.g., "There exists at least one confounder of X and Y"), check for a variable Z that directly causes both X and Y (i.e., Z → X and Z → Y).
     - Principle: The hypothesis is supported (true) only if the final graph clearly reflects the causal relationship as claimed without contradicting the independence evidence. Otherwise, it is not supported (false).
     - Mini-Example: Given a graph where A → B → C and the hypothesis "A is a cause of C, but not directly", the answer would be true because A causes C through B, but there's no direct edge A → C.

  Example 1:
  Premise: Suppose there is a closed system of 6 variables, A, B, C, D, E and F. All the statistical relations among these 6 variables are as follows: A correlates with D. A correlates with E. A correlates with F. B correlates with E. B correlates with F. C correlates with E. C correlates with F. D correlates with E. D correlates with F. E correlates with F. However, A is independent of B.

C and D are independent given B. D and F are independent given A, B, C and E. 
  Hypothesis: There exists at least one collider (i.e., common effect) of B and C.

  You are a specialist in causal discovery algorithms, particularly the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm, with a proven ability to evaluate complex causal relationships. In this final stage, your task is to assess a specific hypothesis regarding causal relationships between variables. Based on the constructed and oriented graph—derived from correlation statements, independence assertions, v-structures, and the application of Meek rules—determine whether the evidence supports or contradicts the proposed causal hypothesis.

  Task: Evaluate whether the given causal hypothesis is supported by the provided causal graph.

  Premise: {premise}

  Context:
  You are given a causal graph that represents a Markov equivalence class (a CPDAG) derived from the above premises. This graph includes:
  - **Directed edges:** These are relationships that are unambiguously oriented.
  - **Undirected edges:** These represent ambiguous relationships where multiple orientations (across equivalent DAGs) are possible.
  
  IMPORTANT: When evaluating the hypothesis, consider only those completions (i.e., fully oriented DAGs) that respect the above premises, including the separation sets. Do not allow any edge orientations that would violate these conditional independence statements (for example, avoid orienting the ambiguous edges as A → B and C → B simultaneously if that contradicts A ⊥ C ∣ B).
  
  Your task is to determine if the specified hypothesis holds in every valid DAG within this equivalence class. The hypothesis is considered supported (true) only if it is true in all valid completions; if it holds in some but not all, then the answer should be false.
  
  Required Output Format:
  Provide your conclusion as a JSON object with a single boolean field:

    "nodes": {nodes},
    "directed_edges": {directed_edges},
    "undirected_edges": {undirected_edges}
  }}
